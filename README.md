# ASP.Net Core MVC Default Project + Webpack + Typescript

I created a default project in Visual Studio and I added Webpack with Typescript

Go inside the `ClientApp` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```
*The command installs all dependencies in package.json*

Then run:

```bash
npm run build
```

*The command generated the necessary files to `wwwroot`, which are referenced in `Views`*
